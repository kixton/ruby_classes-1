classes allow you to have instance variables

if you have a class Cat, instances of that class represent individual cats

instance variables are properties (name, breed, color, age) that describe that car

@ sign = @instance_variable
instance variable is tied with just the instance of the Class that calls the Method
instance variable can be used in Any method within a class (regular variables cannot)
