Iterators: How are each of these used? What do they return?

ARRAY
-----
	each - takes each value in an array
	map - create new array based on original array
		array.map { |x| x*2 }	#=> [2,4,6,8]
		array 					#=> [1,2,3,4]
	select - select elements from array according to criteria
		array = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

		Non-destructive
		array.select { |x| x > 3 }		#=> [4,5,6]
		array.reject { |x| x < 3 }		#=> [3,4,5,6]
		array.drop_while { |x| x < 4 }	#=> [4,5,6]

		Destructive
		array.delete_if { |x| x < 4 }
		array.keep if { |x| x < 4 }

	find - ??

HASHES
------
	each - passes the key-value pair of a hash through a block 

	select - returns key-value pairs that meet the criteria (block is TRUE)
		hash.select { |k,v| v < 200} #=> {"a" => 100, "b" => 150}

	reject - returns key-value pairs (block is FALSE)

	keep_if - deletes every key-value pair from the hash for which the block = FALSE

OTHER
------
How does an if expression work? Conditional Execution

if condition 	# evaluates to true
	code
elsif condition
	code
else
	code
